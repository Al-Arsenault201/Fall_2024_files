# string operators +
# + means concatenate - run two strings together
first = "UMBC"
second = "Retrievers"
total = first+second

# arithmetic operators
# floating point
# + is addition
# - is subtraction
# / is division
# * is multiplication
# ** is exponentiation

# integer math is similar except:
# // - integer division; quotient ignore remainder
# % - modulus; remoinder only ignore quotient

# comparison operators
# come after arithmetic in precedence
# == to compare two values for equality
# != means not equal

#assignment
# = assign the value
# others to make lazy computer scientists happy
# +=, -=, /=, *=
# //= will work IF it's an integer
